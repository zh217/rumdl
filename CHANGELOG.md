## [0.0.192] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Config: `cache` option to disable caching via config file (closes #153)**
  - Add `cache = false` to `[global]` section to persistently disable caching
  - Eliminates need to pass `--no-cache` flag on every invocation
  - Works in both `.rumdl.toml` and `pyproject.toml`

## [0.0.176] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- **Git-style intelligent configuration merging**
  - User and project configs can now intelligently combine instead of simply overriding
  - `disable` array uses union semantics - user can add to project disables
  - `enable` array uses replace semantics - project can enforce specific rules
  - When a rule appears in both `enable` and `disable`, `enable` wins (project can override user)
  - Configuration hierarchy is now explicit and follows Git's pattern:
    - Default (0) < UserConfig (1) < PyprojectToml (2) < ProjectConfig (3) < CLI (4)
  - Renamed config sources for clarity:
    - `ConfigSource::RumdlToml` → `UserConfig` (global user config)
    - `ConfigSource::RumdlToml` → `ProjectConfig` (project-level config files)
    - Removed `Markdownlint` source (now uses `ProjectConfig`)
  - New API methods:
    - `SourcedValue::merge_union()` - additive merging for disable arrays
    - `SourcedValue::merge_override()` - replacement merging for enable arrays
  - Example use cases:
    - User disables MD013 globally → Project enables MD013 → MD013 is enabled ✓
    - Project disables MD001, MD003 → User disables MD013 → All three are disabled ✓
  - 17 comprehensive tests covering merge semantics, precedence, and conflict resolution
  - Matches configuration pattern used by git, eslint, prettier, and other modern tools

### Performance

- **Major memory optimizations eliminating string allocations**
  - Converted `LineInfo` to use byte ranges instead of owned strings (50-80% memory reduction)
  - Eliminates N string allocations where N = number of lines in document
  - Added zero-copy `content(&self, source: &str) -> &str` method for on-demand access
  - Converted `LineIndex` to borrow `&'a str` instead of cloning (eliminates one full document copy per lint operation)
  - Converted `ParsedLink`/`ParsedImage` to use `Cow<'a, str>` (60-80% reduction in heap allocations for link/image parsing)
  - Zero-cost when borrowing, minimal overhead when owning - most data borrowed directly from source

- **Eliminated O(n²) complexity in multiple rules**
  - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD027 (Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol)
  - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD020 (No space inside hashes on closed atx style heading)
  - Fixed quadratic bottlenecks in MD046 (Code block style)
  - All three rules now use pre-computed context data with O(1) lookups

- **Optimized CLI commands**
  - `rumdl config` now executes in ~18ms (eliminated duplicate rule instantiation)
  - Removed duplicate instantiation of ~50 rule objects between main.rs and formatter.rs
  - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth for rule instances

### Fixed

- **Config loading: User config now always loaded as base layer (#131)**
  - Fixed LSP server ignoring user config when finding project-level config files
  - User configuration is now always loaded first (unless `--no-config` is used)
  - Project configs merge on top of user config, CLI flags have highest priority
  - Configuration hierarchy now consistent between CLI and LSP:
    1. User/global config (`~/.config/rumdl/rumdl.toml`) - base layer
    2. Project config (discovered or explicit) - overrides user config
    3. CLI flags - highest priority
  - Matches pattern used by git, eslint, prettier, and other tools
  - Added regression test verifying user config preserved with explicit project config

- **MD035: Frontmatter delimiter false positives (#40)**
  - Fixed incorrect flagging of YAML/TOML frontmatter delimiters (`---`/`+++`) as horizontal rules
  - Rule now correctly skips frontmatter in three places:
    - `most_prevalent_hr_style()` - don't count frontmatter HRs for prevalence
    - `check()` - don't flag frontmatter delimiters as violations
    - `fix()` - don't replace frontmatter delimiters when fixing
  - Uses pre-computed `LineInfo.in_front_matter` field for efficient detection

### Changed

- **Architecture: Consistent use of pre-computed context data**
  - MD035 now uses pre-computed `LineInfo.in_front_matter` instead of function calls
  - All rules now consistently use `ctx.line_index` for line-based operations
  - Eliminates redundant function calls and O(n) scans
  - More efficient with O(1) field access patterns

- **Test infrastructure improvements**
  - Implemented dynamic fixture downloading for performance tests
  - Test downloads now happen on-demand instead of being checked into repository
  - Better handling of large test files for performance benchmarking

- **Test quality improvements**
  - Corrected ESM block test assertions to match actual MDX behavior
  - ESM blocks only exist at TOP of MDX files and end at first non-ESM line
  - Tests now assert correct behavior rather than documenting implementation quirks
  - Fixed MD033 test assertions to properly validate HTML inline rules

### Breaking Changes

**For library users only** (CLI users unaffected):

- `LineInfo.content` field is no longer public - use new `content(source: &str)` method instead
- Since `LineInfo` was primarily internal API, impact should be minimal

  - Cache stored in `.rumdl-cache/{version}/{hash}.json`
  - CLI flags: `--no-cache` to disable, `--cache-dir` to customize location
  - Enabled by default for instant subsequent runs

- **Thread-Safe Parallel Caching**: Best of both worlds - parallelization AND caching
  - Implemented Arc<Mutex<LintCache>> for safe cache sharing across threads
  - Mutex locked ONLY for brief cache get/set operations
  - Full parallelization during expensive linting operations
  - Matches Ruff's architecture for optimal performance

- **Convergence Detection**: Added hash-based detection to identify when fixes have stabilized
  - Stops iteration when content hash remains unchanged

- **Cache Correctness**: Include enabled rules in cache key (Ruff-style)
  - Cache now respects `--enable`/`--disable` CLI flags
  - Different rule configurations create separate cache entries
  - Prevents incorrect cached results when switching rule sets
  - Changed `LintWarning.rule_name` from `Option<&'static str>` to `Option<String>` for proper serialization
